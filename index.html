                  <p class="beginningsText">Tyler grew up in a small town in Iowa called Oskaloosa. Since he was young he has loved anything and everything to do with motocross sports. 
                     He started riding things like ATVs & four-wheelers at a very young age. Time spent not riding motorbikes or ATVs was spent playing video games or watching his 
                     favorite athletes drive monster trucks. His father knew people in the industry on a personal level, which turned out to be the catalyst
                     to getting his foot in the door into the Monster Jam world when he graduated high school. He showed a lot of enthusiasm when talking in length to recruiters for 
                     Monster Jam and was asked to try out.

                     <h1 class= "row align-items-center">The Journey Begins</h1>
                     <p>After trying out, the recruiters for Monster Jam were impressed and Tyler accepted a job offer. He went to Monster Jam University in Wisconsin,
                        which is a large area for new Monster Jam drivers to go to upon signing on to receive training. This training includes how to operate the truck and various equipment,
                        how to speak to press and do interviews, and manage a social media profile. <br><br>
                        Tyler started out driving for Blue Thunder. He performed in various events and tournaments, and quickly garnered a dedicated fanbase.
                        After a couple years of driving Blue Thunder and making a name for himself, he switched teams to drive for Grave Digger, marking a high point in his early career.
                        He continued to gain fans and win competitions, he is most notably known for being a repeated winner of the Triple Threat Championship Series of events which
                        include racing and freestyle. Things were put on hold for a while due to the Coronavirus Pandemic, though Monster Jam drivers
                        still do interviews and connect with their fans online.
